# CS 4420

This repository contains my final project, built using ReactJS, for the course CS 4420: Database Systems.

CS 4420 introduces general database concepts as well as database system technology. The course also covers ER and R data models, R-algebra, SQL, data storage and indexing, query optimization, database design and security.

I completed this course at UCCS in December 2021. This project is a data visualization of literacy and numeracy rates divided by county. The data for this project was gathered from PIAAC (Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies). This project was completed with another classmate.
